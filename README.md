# Election Dapp

## Setup


A simple voting dapp built with Ethereum, javascript and solidity. We selected the Testing and Automation in Web 3.0 for this project

We will be using truffle for the testing phase.

To run:

cd election-dapp
truffle compile 
//run ganache gui or cli before making migrations 
truffle migrate

//we have 6 tests in the /test/election.js 
truffle test

once we execute this command we will see the tests passing or failing


The output is available in the output.doc file
